# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method? 
I feel fairly confident, but I know I could use much more work with this.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? 
I felt that I had much more of a productive struggle this time than unproductive, so there's definitely improvement there! Overall I feel good about the experience and was much more inclined to reach out after 20 min of being stuck like my goal.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still would really like to dive in and research more methods in Ruby. This is fascinating, and there is a lot to be learned! For now during Mod 0, I will just try to keep pace with the assignments better. But when I have some time after I will definitely make time to research at the end of my day.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? I still have questions about some of the practice questions in this assignment. I will ask them tomorrow in my small group!
